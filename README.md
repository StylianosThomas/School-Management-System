Introduction
    A web application created with PHP in order to get familiar with database integration and SQL queries.
    I also wanted to see how bootstrap is implemented so i added a bitof that too.
    The design is basic but functional as the idea was to create a site that requires user input and connects with a database to store and retrieve this data.

Tools Used
    I used wampserver64 and phpMyAdmin to interact with the database.
    The file school.sql has to be executed in phpMyAdmin to create the database.
    The rest of the files were written through Visual Studio Code.
